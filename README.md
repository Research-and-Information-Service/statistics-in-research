# statistics-in-research

This repo hosts documentation detailing the use of statistics in public sector research. 

## Statistics in Research

This documentation covers the basics of descriptive and inferential statistics. It assumes no prior knowledge of statistics and details everything needed to get started. This course can only hope to provide an introduction to statistics, it is not a complete overview of all of the relevant statistics in public sector research but the course should provide a jumping off point for future learning.

## Structure of the Documentation

The documentation can be tackled over a period of days, weeks or months or used as a reference for already experienced researchers, data analyists or statisticians. The contents detail the following: 

* Sampling
* Measures of Uncertainty
* Data Types and Levels of Measurement
* Methods for describing data
* Methods for comparing data
* Inferential Statistics
* Correlation
* Chi Square Tests
* Data Visualisation

## How to use

The documentation is hosted through GitHub and available as an [interactive document](https://research-and-information-service.github.io/statistics-in-research/). The documentation should prove useful to those interested in learning basic descriptive statistics however more advanced topics are also detailed.

## Contributions

It is the author's intention that this documentation be updated in the future to cover a range of additional topics including the use of linear and non linear regression, more complex statistical modelling and introductory machine learning models.
